                <h3>How to buy a PlayStation 5?</h3>
                <p>There are currently two iterations of the PS5: the PS5 ($499.99) and the PS5 Digital Edition ($399.99). There is very little difference between the two — the Digital Edition just lacks the ability to play disc-based games. Both models still feature the same 825GB SSD, CPU, and GPU. There are some more granular differences, like power draw, but there is very little separating the two consoles. Given that the Digital Edition lacks a disc drive, it’s a little smaller and lighter than the $499.99 model.</p>
                <h3>Where is the best place to buy a PS5?</h3>
                <p>Each retailer has a slightly different approach to how it handles restock events. Given the relative scarcity of Sony’s console, retailers have each adopted their own methods to circumvent bots and scalpers, which typically involve digitally queueing at a storefront and logging in with a specific account. If you check availability at a physical store in your area, however, you might have better luck, as in-store restocks often occur with little notice — that is, unless you’ve signed up for notifications from a service like GPU Drops.</p>
